1/ Remove unnecessary spaces
In VS Code : replace "  " (2 spaces) by " " (1 spaces) 
Hit replace all until no double space is left

2/ opcodes and other corrections
replace "BRA" by "JMP"
replace "DEC" by 2 lines :
  SEC 
  SBC #$01
chack labels. They souhldn't start with a number. 80col produce an error in Merlin 8

3/ Save with a new name
I usually add A2 to the name of my source
myprog.s becomes myprogA2.save

4/ End of lines
Use your favorite hex editor to replace "OAOD" hex string by "OD"
Save file.

5/Transfer to Apple II
I use Ciderpress to copy files ton Floppy emu
In the image disk, with Ciderpress, change source file attributs to TXT. Aux value remains 0000.
The bin file (complied) attributes, if copied, must be changed to : BIN ($06),
and Aux value to the loading address (depending on youy "org" instruction)

6/ On a real Apple II 
Launch Merlin 8
Set prefix
Load source 
Enter editor (e) and try to assemble (asm)
You will probably encounter new errors, quite simple to correct, like too long lines
You will want to add a  LST OFF instruction, for faster assembling.
